## Eye Disease Classification using Fundus Images


The project involves training a multilabel image classifier that predicts eye diseases with a high accuracy.

Current code involves implementing transfer learning on VGG16 model in Keras and fine tuning it to obtain results

The model predicted the images with a testing accuracy of 96% on three labels.. When training a 4 label classifier, the accuracy dropped to * 82% * on test data
